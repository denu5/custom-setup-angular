# Custom Setup Angular
A basic angular(^4.1.3) setup with AOT, lazy loading and routing baked in.

## Getting started
`git clone https://github.com/jsdevtom/custom-setup-angular && npm install`

## Run
`npm start`

## Run with AOT
`npm run start:prod`

## Build with AOT
`npm run build:prod`

## Motivations
This was made so that I would gain a deeper understanding of angular under the hood. Feel free to use it as a starter though.
